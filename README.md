Fork of
github.com/FossifyOrg/Phone

If you want to create custom ROMs without calling functionality (for example, for use with apps like Waze only), simply deleting the Dialer app is not enough. The phone will still ring if someone calls, and you won’t be able to reject the call.

This modified dialer blocks all calls — incoming and outgoing.
